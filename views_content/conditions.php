              <h4>Warranty</h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">Our limited labor warranty in regard to correcting defects in our workmanship is 90 days. If a part fails owing to a manufacturer's defect, however, our labor is covered for just 60 days. There is no warranty against additional or more extensive repairs, against other problems that may occur on the same machine (even if involving what appear to be identical symptoms), or against incidental damages. Parts carry the manufacturer's warranty, which is usually 30-90 days dependent on manufacturer.</p>
              <h4>Payment and Conditions of Service Provision
              </h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">It is the responsibility of the customer to familiarize themselves with terms of service at time of scheduling and prior to allowing our technician to commence provision of service. Scheduling of service with us implies full acceptance of our terms and conditions as detailed, as does allowing our technician to commence service. Acting either for yourself or for the party listed on electronic or paper work order/ job sheet, you agree to pay all the following where applicable: any unpaid balance upon completion, 24% APR Interest and service charges on any past due balance, a $30 service fee if your check or credit card is not honored by the bank, necessary handling and return charges if your work order is canceled in an untimely fashion, and any necessary collection costs, including attorney's fees. Payment is due on provision of service unless terms have been agreed or other previous arrangements have been made.</p>
              <h4>Cancellation of Service</h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">When scheduling service with us, we specifically take time out a technicians day to call on your location and service your product. When you forget, cancel, or change your appointment without giving enough notice, we miss the opportunity to fill that appointment time, and clients on our wait list miss the opportunity to receive services which in turn results in a loss of revenue which cannot be recovered. Consequently, we reserve the right to charge equal to 100% of the service call amount for any appointment missed, canceled, or changed without 8 business hours notice or otherwise mutually agreed.</p>
              <h4>Damage Waivers</h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">It is the responsibility of the customer to familiarize themselves with waivers we have in place surrounding the provision of any services we provide. These waivers are applicable for all work performed and are assumed and accepted once you allow our technician to commence provision of service.</p>
              <h4>
                Waiver of Damages When Moving Appliance</h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">You understand there is inherent risk in such movement.  There is risk of damage to the machine itself, and to areas surrounding its installation, including but not limited to flooring, cabinetry and counter tops.  You acknowledge the technician is not required to move the appliance.  In exchange for his willingness to do so, you promise to hold faultless, both the technician and JumpStart Appliance Repair, from any and every liability associated with any such damage as may occur in connection with this movement.</p>
              <h4>Waiver of Damages When Working with Water</h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">You understand the machinery that’s being worked on is connected with the building’s plumbing system, and whenever any machinery is so connected, there is an inherent risk that component failure, imperfect connections and/or other faults could result in unintended leakage and/or flooding within the building, causing significant and sometimes catastrophic damage.  Excepting for cases of gross, clearly proven, and explicitly identifiable carelessness by the technician, you promise to hold harmless JumpStart Appliance Repair  its principals, agents and employees from any and all damages, harms or liability that may result from such an occurrence.

              <h4>Waiver of Damages from Failed Cooling</h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">You understand that, like any machinery, refrigeration equipment consists of a multiplicity of complex components, any of which can fail without warning, and that any effort to service and/or repair same carries inherent risk.  Diagnoses are not always straightforward, and, even when carefully performed, repair and/or service work may involve imperfections that result in failure of the machinery to perform as intended.  Such failures may lead to food spoilage, discomfort, inconvenience, and (particularly in commercial contexts) even loss of revenue as associated with cancelled or failed events, inability to service customers, etc.  You acknowledge that, by undertaking to service and/or repair your equipment, JumpStart Appliance Repair is not accepting responsibility for any such risks.

              </h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">You understand that, in lifting a glass/ceramic cook top surface to access components below it, there is an inherent risk of breakage.  The top is attached with strong adhesive, and it is not always possible to achieve separation without the surface fracturing.  While expecting the technician to exercise every due level of care, You nevertheless recognize that the Technician and JumpStart Appliance Repair explicitly refrain from accepting any responsibility for these risks.  You agree all such risks are your own, and you agree to hold harmless and exempt from liability JumpStart Appliance Repair, it’s agents and employees from any and all such responsibility.  By allowing the technician to commence work, you explicitly waive the right to any contrary claim.</p>
              <h4>Basic Appliance Installation Terms and Conditions</h4>
              <p class="inset-xxl-right-120">Our standard install charge covers the following:

                </br>

                Removal and/or installation of an appliance, without the need to disturb/remove cabinetry, countertops, flooring or any other fixture. Does not include modification, and repair of gas, water valves, drains, power receptacles, electrical junction boxes, and dryer vents. It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure systems for the supply of gas and water, electrical, drainage, venting etc. meet local building codes, and are available to facilitate installation using standard materials associated with the install of that type of appliance.

                JumpStart Appliance does not install, modify or correct problems with services necessary to facilitate installation. These include but are not limited to electrical supply, water supply, water drainage, gas supply, dryer air vents, ventilation systems to facilitate cooling and/or safe operation of equipment installed.

                </br>

                We assume and accept that the area, systems or services which have been provided to accommodate the appliance installation have been prepared to conform to the needs of the appliance and meet all applicable regulatory requirements and codes. We do not verify correct ventilation, electrical, water supply, water drainage requirements have been met specific to the appliance installed.

                Installation charge quoted does not include cost of materials such as vent hoses, water lines, gas lines, hoses, fittings etc.

                Where 2 people are required to install an appliance, such as with stacked dryer/washers and wall ovens, this will incur an additional service charge in addition to charge for basic install.

                </br>

                Should we call to perform an install and find that installation cannot proceed and cannot be corrected while on site due to any one of the above criteria not being met, our standard service call will be due.
